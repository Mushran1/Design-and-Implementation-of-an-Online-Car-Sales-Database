# Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive database for an online car sales platform. The database aims to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information related to electric vehicles, facilitating seamless navigation and data extraction for end-users.

## Project Objectives
Competitive Analysis: Conducted an analysis of existing online car sales platforms, focusing on TrueCar and other competitors, to understand industry standards and features.
Sitemap Creation: Developed a sitemap to visualize the end-user experience and determine the necessary data points and their relationships.
Business Rules and Requirements: Collaborated with stakeholders to define the database's capabilities and functionalities.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Created an ERD to outline the relationships between tables and eliminate many-to-many relationships through bridge tables.
Database Construction: Built the database tables, inserted sample data, and connected the database to a local server using PHP for seamless user interaction.
### Methodology
#### Competitive Analysis:

- Analyzed TrueCar and other competitors to understand the data structure and features used in current online car sales platforms.
- Gained insights into the types of data collected and how it is utilized.
#### Sitemap Creation:

- Developed a sitemap to envision the end-user's journey.
- Identified the data points required to meet user needs and their interrelationships.
#### Business Rules and Requirements:

- Defined business rules and requirements in collaboration with stakeholders.
- Ensured the database meets the functional and operational needs of the platform.
#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):

- Created an ERD to map out the relationships between database entities.
- Eliminated many-to-many relationships by establishing bridge tables.
#### Database Construction:

- Created SQL scripts to build tables and insert sample data.
- Connected the database to a local server using PHP.
- Developed a web interface with navigation features, including images, table headers, and column names.
### Implementation
#### Database Creation:

- Designed and implemented tables based on the ERD.
- Inserted sample data to represent electric vehicles and their attributes.
#### Connecting to the Server:

- Used SQL queries and PHP to connect the database to the localhost server.
- Imported data to the local server and set up a web interface for end-users.
#### User Navigation:

- Developed a user-friendly web interface to facilitate easy navigation and data extraction.
- Included images, table headers, and column names to enhance the user experience.
## Conclusion
The design and implementation of this online car sales database provide a robust framework for managing and retrieving information on electric vehicles. By conducting a thorough competitive analysis, defining clear business rules, and creating a detailed ERD, we ensured the database meets industry standards and user needs. The final product is a functional database connected to a local server, ready for end-users to navigate and extract relevant information efficiently.
